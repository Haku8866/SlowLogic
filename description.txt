Slow Logic adds a delay between the TripWire() function being called and the TripWire() function actually being executed.
You can set the delay to 0 ticks and your game will not crash if you hook the output of a logic gate back to the input.

As long as your circuit does not involve smoke, it should work with this mod enabled.

It's important to note that this mod does not add a propagation delay to logic gates specifically, but rather a delay to all wiring components. This means that there will be a delay inserted between you flicking a switch and the switch sending an output.
I haven't tested this in multiplayer, it's not designed to be a multiplayer mod.
